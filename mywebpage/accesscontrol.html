<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>
    There are several approaches to **authorization**, which is the process of determining what a user or system is allowed to do after authentication. These approaches vary depending on the system design, security requirements, and complexity. Common approaches to authorization include:

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Overview**: Permissions are assigned based on the roles users are given. A role represents a set of permissions, and users are assigned roles based on their function in an organization or system.
   - **Example**: A "Manager" role might have access to employee data and reports, while a "Staff" role might only have access to their own profile.
   - **Strengths**: Easy to manage and scalable in large organizations.
   - **Weaknesses**: Can become complex when a user requires multiple roles or permissions outside their role.

### 2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - **Overview**: Access is granted based on attributes (such as user properties, resource properties, or environmental conditions). Policies are defined using attributes rather than predefined roles.
   - **Example**: A policy might allow access to a document if the user's department is "HR" and the document's sensitivity level is "low."
   - **Strengths**: Very flexible and granular.
   - **Weaknesses**: Can become complicated to manage due to the number of attributes and policies.

### 3. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
   - **Overview**: The resource owner has the authority to decide who is allowed to access specific resources. Permissions are granted at the discretion of the owner.
   - **Example**: A file owner in a system like Linux can set permissions for other users to read, write, or execute the file.
   - **Strengths**: Simple and gives resource owners full control.
   - **Weaknesses**: Less secure, as users may unintentionally grant access to unauthorized users.

### 4. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
   - **Overview**: Access is based on a system-wide policy that cannot be altered by individual users. Users and resources are classified into levels of security, and the system enforces access rules.
   - **Example**: A government system where access to documents is based on clearance levels (e.g., Top Secret, Secret).
   - **Strengths**: Highly secure, ideal for environments requiring strict control (e.g., military or governmental).
   - **Weaknesses**: Rigid and complex to implement and manage.

### 5. **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**
   - **Overview**: Access is governed by a set of policies that define rules for authorization. These policies are written separately from the application's code, allowing dynamic control of permissions.
   - **Example**: Policies could be created based on time of day, geographic location, or specific actions within the application.
   - **Strengths**: Flexible and adaptable to various scenarios.
   - **Weaknesses**: Requires good policy management and can be complex to configure.

### 6. **Token-Based Authorization (OAuth)**
   - **Overview**: Access tokens are used to authorize users or systems. Users authenticate, receive a token, and present it to access resources. OAuth is widely used in web and API authentication scenarios.
   - **Example**: A user logs in with a social media account (OAuth provider) and receives a token to access third-party applications.
   - **Strengths**: Lightweight, works well with APIs and mobile applications.
   - **Weaknesses**: Token management and expiration need careful handling for security.

### 7. **Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC)**
   - **Overview**: Access is granted based on the identity of the user or system. This is often the simplest form of access control, where identity determines what resources a user can access.
   - **Example**: A user with a particular email address may be allowed access to specific resources.
   - **Strengths**: Simple and straightforward.
   - **Weaknesses**: Does not support complex permission requirements.

### 8. **Risk-Adaptive Access Control (RAdAC)**
   - **Overview**: Access decisions are based on the risk involved in granting access. The system dynamically adjusts access based on real-time risk assessments, such as behavioral patterns or environmental factors.
   - **Example**: A user accessing a system from an unfamiliar device may have restricted access until additional verification is completed.
   - **Strengths**: Adaptable and responsive to changing conditions, improving security.
   - **Weaknesses**: Requires complex risk modeling and monitoring.

### 9. **Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC)**
   - **Overview**: Access is controlled at a very detailed level, often down to individual records or fields within a dataset.
   - **Example**: A customer service representative can only view certain fields (like name and address) but cannot access sensitive fields (like payment information).
   - **Strengths**: Provides very specific and tailored access to sensitive data.
   - **Weaknesses**: Can be difficult to manage due to the high level of granularity required.

Each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages, and they can be combined depending on the system's needs for security, flexibility, and usability.
