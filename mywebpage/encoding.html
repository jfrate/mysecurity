<h2>Encoding</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Encoding</strong> is the process of converting data from one format to another. 
    An algorithm maps characters from the source format to the destination format.
</p>

<p>
    Encoding is primarily used to transform data into a format compatible with a specific system or medium, typically for transmission or storage.
</p>

<p>
    Encoding plays a fundamental role in security. While encoding itself does not protect data—since it is not a cryptographic function—it is essential for many security mitigations that will be discussed.
</p>

<p>
    Developers often use encoding schemes in their projects without fully understanding the underlying processes. In this section, we’ll provide an overview of some common encoding algorithms to help you gain a deeper understanding of how encoding works.
</p>

<p>
    There are many types of encoding algorithms used for different purposes. Below are some of the most common encoding algorithms every developer should be familiar with:
</p>

<ul class="indented-list">
    <li><strong>Character Encoding</strong> (e.g., ASCII, Unicode such as UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32)</li>
    <li><strong>Binary Encoding</strong> (e.g., Base64, Hexadecimal)</li>
    <li><strong>URL Encoding</strong></li>
    <li><strong>HTML Encoding</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
    For example, when sending data over the web, encoding can 
    ensure special characters (like spaces or symbols) are 
    safely transmitted.
</p>

<p>
Reversible<br>
Encoding is <b>reversible</b>, meaning the original data can be 
decoded without any loss of information. The process converts 
data into a new format but does not alter the content itself.
</p>

<p>
Common Use Cases<br>
<b>Character Encoding</b><br>
Different systems interpret text differently. Encoding formats 
like **UTF-8** or **ASCII** ensure consistent text display across 
devices and platforms.'
</p>

<p>
<b>URL Encoding</b><br>
Converts special characters in URLs (like spaces and symbols) 
into a format that can be transmitted safely, replacing them 
with encoded representations (e.g., `%20` for a space).
</p>

<p>
</b>Base64 Encoding</b><br>
Converts binary data (like images or files) into a text format 
that can be embedded in web pages or emails.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    <b>Examples</b><br>
1. **Text Encoding (UTF-8)**:
   - Original: `Hello, world!`
   - Encoded (UTF-8): The text is represented in bytes that the computer can interpret consistently across different systems.

2. **URL Encoding**:
   - Original: `https://example.com/search?query=hello world`
   - Encoded: `https://example.com/search?query=hello%20world`

3. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - Used to encode binary data (like an image) into a string.
   - Original (binary data): `[binary data of an image]`
   - Encoded: `iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS...`

### Difference from Encryption:
- **Encoding** does not provide confidentiality. The encoded data can still be understood if someone has access to it.
- **Encryption**, on the other hand, transforms data in a way that only authorized parties can decode, providing data secrecy.

### Difference from Hashing:
- **Encoding** is reversible, whereas **hashing** is not. Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string, usually to ensure integrity, but it cannot be turned back into its original form.

In summary, **encoding** is a method for representing data in a format that different systems can handle, ensuring compatibility without altering the underlying content or securing it like encryption.
