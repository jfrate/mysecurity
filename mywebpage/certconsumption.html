To consume and use an **X.509 certificate** in Java, you typically rely on the `java.security` package, specifically `CertificateFactory` and `X509Certificate` classes.

Here's a simple Java program that reads an X.509 certificate from a file and prints its details:

### Steps:
1. Create a PEM or DER formatted certificate file.
2. Use the `CertificateFactory` class to load and parse the certificate.
3. Extract relevant information from the certificate like the subject, issuer, validity, and more.

### Example Java Program to Consume an X.509 Certificate:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.security.cert.CertificateFactory;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import java.util.Date;

public class X509CertificateReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Path to your certificate file (PEM or DER)
            String certPath = "path/to/your/certificate.crt";
            
            // Create a CertificateFactory for X.509
            CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
            
            // Load the certificate from file
            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(certPath);
            X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate) cf.generateCertificate(fis);
            
            // Print details from the X.509 certificate
            System.out.println("Certificate Details:");
            
            // Subject: Information about the entity the certificate is issued to
            System.out.println("Subject: " + cert.getSubjectDN());
            
            // Issuer: Information about the certificate authority (CA)
            System.out.println("Issuer: " + cert.getIssuerDN());
            
            // Serial number of the certificate
            System.out.println("Serial Number: " + cert.getSerialNumber());
            
            // Validity period of the certificate
            System.out.println("Valid From: " + cert.getNotBefore());
            System.out.println("Valid To: " + cert.getNotAfter());
            
            // Public key associated with the certificate
            System.out.println("Public Key: " + cert.getPublicKey());
            
            // Signature Algorithm used
            System.out.println("Signature Algorithm: " + cert.getSigAlgName());
            
            // Check if the certificate is currently valid
            try {
                cert.checkValidity(new Date());
                System.out.println("The certificate is currently valid.");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("The certificate is not valid: " + e.getMessage());
            }
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading certificate: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Use:
1. **Certificate File**: Store your X.509 certificate as a `.crt` or `.cer` file, which could be in PEM or DER format.
   
2. **Replace `certPath`**: Change the `certPath` in the program to point to your certificate file.

3. **Run the Program**: Compile and run the program. It will load the X.509 certificate, parse its details, and print information like the subject, issuer, and validity period.

### Key Notes:
- If your certificate is in PEM format (Base64 with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`), the code will work without changes, as Java will handle PEM-encoded certificates transparently.
- If your certificate is in DER format (binary), this program works as is too.
- Ensure that your Java environment has the necessary permissions to read the certificate file.

This code is a simple example, but you can extend it to perform more complex tasks such as verifying the certificate chain, extracting extensions, or handling certificate validation errors.
